# Systematic Evaluation of CASH Search Strategies for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
Repository for the relevant full-paper accepted in [ECML/PKDD 2022](https://2022.ecmlpkdd.org/), and specifically for the [LIDTA-2022 workshop](https://lidta.dcc.fc.up.pt/).

**Note**: This repository initially served as the code repo for my thesis in **[Master of Artificial Intelligence](https://wms.cs.kuleuven.be/cs/studeren/master-artificial-intelligence)** programme at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven) but it was later modified/extended to accommodate the relevant content of the LIDTA-2022 full-paper submission.


## Description
The aim of the thesis is to evaluate the CASH optimization problem for unsupervised anomaly detection by systematically experimenting on different types and sizes of the validation set and compare the performance for the below search strategies:
* Random Search
* Uniform Exploration
* Bayesian Optimization (SMAC)
